<P><FONT COLOR="#444444"><FONT SIZE=4>Foot Faults. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>A player may warn an opponent that the opponent has committed a
flagrant foot fault. If the foot faulting continues, the player may
attempt to locate an official. If no official is available, the
player may call flagrant foot faults. Compliance with the foot fault
rule is very much a function of a player&rsquo;s personal honor
system. The plea that a Server should not be penalized because the
server only just touched the line and did not rush the net is not
acceptable. Habitual foot faulting, whether intentional or
careless,is just as surely cheating as is making a deliberate bad
line call.</P>
