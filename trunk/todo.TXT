*** Phillip Schumacher went offline at 5:04 PM
(10:29 AM) Will Han: Phil, I worked around 4 hours earlier this moring, how do I log this time?
(10:30 AM) Phillip Schumacher: What did you work on? The performance issues?
(10:30 AM) Will Han: performance issues and a CMF bug
(10:30 AM) Phillip Schumacher: Don't we already have a ticket for the performance?
(10:32 AM) Phillip Schumacher: Ticket 2705
(10:33 AM) Will Han: yes, we do, i mean how do we keep track of OT?
(10:35 AM) Phillip Schumacher: I will ask HR.
(10:36 AM) Will Han: Okay thanks
(11:40 AM) Phillip Schumacher: Good morning Will.
(11:40 AM) Phillip Schumacher: In regards to the OT... I got the following response back from HR.
(11:40 AM) Phillip Schumacher: It is expected that Decisioning Solutions employees will work a regularly scheduled work week Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each day; however, there may, from time to time, be circumstances where overtime is required.

Should overtime become excessive, employees can seek approval for time in lieu of overtime worked through their direct supervisor.  Each request will be evaluated on a case by case basis.”

(11:40 AM) Phillip Schumacher: This is from your employee contract with DS.
(11:41 AM) Will Han: okay can I get time in lieu Phil?
(11:42 AM) Phillip Schumacher: How many hours did you work over time Will?
(11:43 AM) Will Han: more than 3 hours:12~2:20am
7:19am~8:38 am
(11:44 AM) Phillip Schumacher: In your contract it is in the wording "should over time become excessive". Will do you consider 3 hours overtime execessive?
(11:45 AM) Will Han: yes...in the morning...
(11:45 AM) Will Han: but it's all up to you
(11:46 AM) Will Han: i just don't want to block the process that's why i take initialtives to work longer hours
(11:47 AM) Will Han: i consider this switching shift is for this purpose
(11:49 AM) Will Han: of course i am not taking off on a busy time
(11:49 AM) Phillip Schumacher: Sorry Will did not get your last point about switching shift.
(11:49 AM) Will Han: we working in night shift want to make the development cycle faster, right?
(11:50 AM) Phillip Schumacher: Correct.
(11:50 AM) Will Han: that means when i sleep, somebody else can still work, others sleep, i can work...
(11:50 AM) Phillip Schumacher: Correct.
(11:53 AM) Phillip Schumacher: But Will the hours we agreed were something like 10:00 - 4:00 and 10:00 PM to Midnight. Whilst it's shift work it's still a normal day (hours wise). Yes however you have worked additional hours around this.
(11:54 AM) Phillip Schumacher: Anyways I will pass this onto HR again so you guys can discuss. HR make the ultimate decision on this.
(11:54 AM) Will Han: not neccessary to me, just want to state my point
(11:54 AM) Phillip Schumacher: Ok Thanks Will.
(11:55 AM) Phillip Schumacher: In the future could you please send me OT hours? worked?
(11:55 AM) Phillip Schumacher: If they do become substantial then let's review.
(11:55 AM) Will Han: i should seek for your agreement if neccessary OT
